      <h1>Consent to Participate in Research</h1>
      <p>You are being invited to take part in a research study about how people understand short descriptions of everyday events. The study is conducted by researchers in linguistics at The Ohio State University.</p>
      <p>If you agree to participate, you will read a short written scenario and answer a small number of questions about how likely certain events are. The task should take about <strong>5 minutes</strong> to complete. Your participation is voluntary.</p>
      <p>You may stop participating at any time by closing the survey window or returning the study on Prolific. Some questions may require an answer in order to continue, but you are free to stop the study at any point.</p>
      <p>There are no expected risks beyond those normally associated with using a computer or completing an online survey. There are no direct benefits to you, but your responses may help researchers better understand how people interpret language.</p>
      <p>You will be paid through Prolific according to the payment information shown on the Prolific study page. To help us process payment and verify participation, we will collect your Prolific participant ID and basic technical information associated with the survey submission. We will not ask for your name, address, phone number, or other direct identifying information in the survey.</p>
      <p>Your responses will be used for research purposes. Data may be analyzed, presented, or shared in scientific contexts, but results will be reported in summary form and will not identify you personally. Because this is an online study, complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, but the research team will take reasonable steps to protect the data.</p>
      <p>This study has been reviewed by The Ohio State University Institutional Review Board. The study number is 2024B0317. If you have questions about the study, please contact Dongxu Wu at wu.6734@osu.edu. If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions that you do not feel comfortable discussing with the researcher, you may contact The Ohio State University Office of Responsible Research Practices at 614-688-8457 or 800-678-6251.</p>
      <p>By selecting <strong>“Yes, I agree to participate”</strong> and continuing to the survey, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old, that you have read this information, and that you voluntarily agree to participate in this research study.</p>
